Purpose of this document:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive plan for the development and implementation of a stock-maintenance system. This document will outline the scope, requirements, and constraints of the project, as well as the preliminary schedule and budget.

Scope of this document:
This document will cover the development and implementation of a stock-maintenance system for a small retail business. The system will be designed to keep track of inventory levels, facilitate the ordering and restocking of items, and provide real-time reporting on stock levels.

Overview:
The stock-maintenance system will be a web-based application that will be accessible through a web browser. The system will be designed to allow users to manage their inventory levels, generate reports on stock levels and usage, and track the ordering and delivery of new stock.

General Description:
The stock-maintenance system will consist of a front-end web application and a back-end database. The front-end application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing inventory levels, generating reports, and tracking orders. The back-end database will store all of the data related to inventory levels, orders, and reports.

Functional Requirements:

Inventory management - The system must allow users to add, edit, and delete inventory items, as well as view current stock levels.
Order management - The system must allow users to create and track orders for new stock.
Reporting - The system must generate real-time reports on stock levels and usage.
User management - The system must allow administrators to create and manage user accounts, as well as assign user roles and permissions.
Interface Requirements:
The front-end web application must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. The system must be compatible with all major web browsers and should be optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

Performance Requirements:
The stock-maintenance system must be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without any performance issues. The system must also be able to handle large amounts of data without any loss of performance.

Design Constraints:
The stock-maintenance system must be designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The system must also be designed with security in mind, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Non-Functional Attributes:
The stock-maintenance system must be reliable, accurate, and efficient. The system must be easy to use and learn, with clear instructions and guidance provided. The system must also be compatible with other software and systems used by the business.

Preliminary Schedule and Budget:
The development and implementation of the stock-maintenance system is expected to take approximately six months and will require a budget of approximately $50,000. This includes the cost of software development, hardware, and any necessary training or support. A detailed schedule and budget will be provided as part of the project plan.
