Purpose of this document:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive plan for the development and implementation of an online shopping system. This document will outline the scope, requirements, and constraints of the project, as well as the preliminary schedule and budget.

Scope of this document:
This document will cover the development and implementation of an online shopping system for a retail store. The system will be designed to allow customers to browse products, place orders, and make payments online.

Overview:
The online shopping system will be a web-based application that will be accessible through a web browser. The system will be designed to allow customers to browse products, view product details, add products to their shopping cart, and checkout.

General Description:
The online shopping system will consist of a front-end web application, a back-end database, and a payment gateway. The front-end application will provide a user-friendly interface for browsing products, adding items to the shopping cart, and checking out. The back-end database will store all of the data related to products, orders, and customers. The payment gateway will facilitate secure online payments.

Functional Requirements:

Product catalog - The system must allow customers to browse products, view product details, and add items to their shopping cart.
Shopping cart - The system must allow customers to add and remove items from their shopping cart and view the total cost of their order.
Checkout - The system must allow customers to enter their shipping and billing information and make secure online payments.
Order management - The system must allow the retail store to manage orders, track order status, and process refunds.
Interface Requirements:
The front-end web application must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. The system must be compatible with all major web browsers and should be optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

Performance Requirements:
The online shopping system must be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without any performance issues. The system must also be able to handle large amounts of data without any loss of performance.

Design Constraints:
The online shopping system must be designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The system must also be designed with security in mind, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Non-Functional Attributes:
The online shopping system must be reliable, accurate, and efficient. The system must be easy to use and learn, with clear instructions and guidance provided. The system must also be compatible with other software and systems used by the retail store.

Preliminary Schedule and Budget:
The development and implementation of the online shopping system is expected to take approximately six months and will require a budget of approximately $50,000. This includes the cost of software development, hardware, and any necessary training or support. A detailed schedule and budget will be provided as part of the project plan.
