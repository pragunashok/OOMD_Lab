Purpose of this document:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive plan for the development and implementation of a library management system. This document will outline the scope, requirements, and constraints of the project, as well as the preliminary schedule and budget.

Scope of this document:
This document will cover the development and implementation of a library management system for a public library. The system will be designed to automate the library's day-to-day operations, including managing the circulation of books, managing patron accounts, and generating reports.

Overview:
The library management system will be a web-based application that will be accessible through a web browser. The system will be designed to allow users to manage the library's collection of books, track the circulation of books, and manage patron accounts.

General Description:
The library management system will consist of a front-end web application and a back-end database. The front-end application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing the library's collection of books, tracking the circulation of books, and managing patron accounts. The back-end database will store all of the data related to books, circulation, and patron accounts.

Functional Requirements:

Catalog management - The system must allow librarians to add, edit, and delete books from the library's collection, as well as view book information such as title, author, and publication date.
Circulation management - The system must allow librarians to check books in and out, track due dates, and manage fines for overdue books.
Patron management - The system must allow librarians to manage patron accounts, including creating and updating accounts, tracking borrowing history, and managing fines and fees.
Reporting - The system must generate real-time reports on circulation, book availability, and patron accounts.
Interface Requirements:
The front-end web application must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. The system must be compatible with all major web browsers and should be optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

Performance Requirements:
The library management system must be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without any performance issues. The system must also be able to handle large amounts of data without any loss of performance.

Design Constraints:
The library management system must be designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The system must also be designed with security in mind, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Non-Functional Attributes:
The library management system must be reliable, accurate, and efficient. The system must be easy to use and learn, with clear instructions and guidance provided. The system must also be compatible with other software and systems used by the library.

Preliminary Schedule and Budget:
The development and implementation of the library management system is expected to take approximately nine months and will require a budget of approximately $100,000. This includes the cost of software development, hardware, and any necessary training or support. A detailed schedule and budget will be provided as part of the project plan.
