Purpose of this document:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive plan for the development and implementation of a railway reservation system. This document will outline the scope, requirements, and constraints of the project, as well as the preliminary schedule and budget.

Scope of this document:
This document will cover the development and implementation of a railway reservation system that allows passengers to book and manage their train reservations online.

Overview:
The railway reservation system will be a web-based application that will be accessible through a web browser. The system will be designed to allow passengers to search for and book train reservations, view their reservation details, and cancel or modify their reservations.

General Description:
The railway reservation system will consist of a front-end web application, a back-end database, and a payment gateway. The front-end application will provide a user-friendly interface for passengers to search for and book train reservations, view their reservation details, and make changes to their reservations. The back-end database will store all of the data related to train schedules, reservations, and passengers. The payment gateway will facilitate secure online payments.

Functional Requirements:

Train schedule search - The system must allow passengers to search for train schedules and routes, including the availability of seats.
Reservation booking - The system must allow passengers to book train reservations online, with the ability to select their preferred seats and classes.
Payment - The system must allow passengers to make secure online payments for their train reservations.
Reservation modification - The system must allow passengers to modify their reservations, including changing the date, time, and class of travel.
Reservation cancellation - The system must allow passengers to cancel their reservations and receive a refund if applicable.
Interface Requirements:
The front-end web application must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. The system must be compatible with all major web browsers and should be optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

Performance Requirements:
The railway reservation system must be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without any performance issues. The system must also be able to handle large amounts of data without any loss of performance.

Design Constraints:
The railway reservation system must be designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The system must also be designed with security in mind, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Non-Functional Attributes:
The railway reservation system must be reliable, accurate, and efficient. The system must be easy to use and learn, with clear instructions and guidance provided. The system must also be compatible with other software and systems used by railway companies.

Preliminary Schedule and Budget:
The development and implementation of the railway reservation system is expected to take approximately eight months and will require a budget of approximately $200,000. This includes the cost of software development, hardware, and any necessary training or support. A detailed schedule and budget will be provided as part of the project plan.
