Purpose of this document:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive plan for the development and implementation of a passport automation system. This document will outline the scope, requirements, and constraints of the project, as well as the preliminary schedule and budget.

Scope of this document:
This document will cover the development and implementation of a passport automation system that allows applicants to apply, track and receive their passports with ease.

Overview:
The passport automation system will be a web-based application that will be accessible through a web browser. The system will be designed to allow applicants to apply, track and receive their passports online.

General Description:
The passport automation system will consist of a front-end web application, a back-end database, and a payment gateway. The front-end application will provide a user-friendly interface for applicants to apply for their passports, track their application status, and receive their passports. The back-end database will store all of the data related to passport applications, passports, and applicants. The payment gateway will facilitate secure online payments.

Functional Requirements:

Passport application - The system must allow applicants to fill in their passport application online, upload required documents, and submit their application.
Payment - The system must allow applicants to make secure online payments for their passport application.
Passport tracking - The system must allow applicants to track their passport application status online.
Passport delivery - The system must allow applicants to choose a delivery method for their passport, and provide their delivery details.
Interface Requirements:
The front-end web application must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. The system must be compatible with all major web browsers and should be optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

Performance Requirements:
The passport automation system must be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously without any performance issues. The system must also be able to handle large amounts of data without any loss of performance.

Design Constraints:
The passport automation system must be designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The system must also be designed with security in mind, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Non-Functional Attributes:
The passport automation system must be reliable, accurate, and efficient. The system must be easy to use and learn, with clear instructions and guidance provided. The system must also be compatible with other software and systems used by passport offices.

Preliminary Schedule and Budget:
The development and implementation of the passport automation system is expected to take approximately six months and will require a budget of approximately $100,000. This includes the cost of software development, hardware, and any necessary training or support. A detailed schedule and budget will be provided as part of the project plan.
